## UPLOADED FAIRY PAGE 34
Nadine is in a scrapyard in the city, searching for robotic dog parts. In a part of her mind, the memory of the robotic dog that she had wanted to build was still on her mind.
Then she heard the familiar barking of a dog, but could not initially find where it was coming from.

SFX: Bark bark

Nadine looked ahead of her, and there the robotic dog she had once tried building was missing one of its ears, laying in the scrap heap.

NADINE: Is that really you? Come here.

The robotic dog hopped into NADINE's arms, and then licked her face.

NADINE: It has been so long.
