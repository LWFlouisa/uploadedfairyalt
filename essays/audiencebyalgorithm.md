### Audience By Algorithm

I don’t feel particularly inclined to do more Youtube videos. This is not because I do not like making videos, but because of certain issues with the website they still have yet to work out. It should not be nearly as easy as it is to downvote a video into oblivion, simply because I as a creator dare to have a different opinion than what is currently popular on the website, which doesn’t always reflect what the majority of people actually feel. There is also the fact that the people I thought agreed with me on issues, only do so conditionally, and they probably so many exceptions to this they might as well say do not believe this. Gender Critical and Gender Abolitionist circles is one example. But there are countless other groups also like this.

The expectation, when pitching your essay to readers, is that you genuinely feel the ideas that you are expressing in it. Not that you were willing to express those ideas for money, or to get a boost in the algorithm score on a video streaming website. Specifically, essays are about truth. Readers expect you to be truthful when trying to persuade them of a point. And countless times both gender abolitionist and gender critical people have failed to be truthful about issues they express.

Every single time I have uploaded a video, there has been an invisible angry mob spamming my comments section, and I have to basically turn my comments off and turn off ratings just to get any kind of peace of mind. This is how the formula for producing videos that are truthful in nature, or mostly truthful with some artistic license.

I thought that the Gender Critical people agreed with me the most, but even then this agreement is often conditional in nature, and they will often switch sides essentially on a dime, where they think they will recieve the most accolades. But truth is important when we are dealing with a post Truth society, and we have people that, on one hand, encourage people to defend J.K. Rowling, or on the other side, encourage people to bash J.K. Rowling. These are not issues that I am interested in, despite being a trans person myself.

These days, I post the majority of my videos on Peertube these days, because I honestly do not find Youtube to be repairable. It is permanently broken, with the algorithm rewarding the opinions that are the most controversial or silatious rather than genuine and truthful. Even in comics, one of favorite topics aside from writing, does not base the popularity of content on truthfulness, but how much you can play to your audience desires and whims.
