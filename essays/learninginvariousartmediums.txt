## Learning In Various Art Mediums
In order to get the most out of the drawing experience, you need various utensils. You need charcoal to produce adequate shadows. Graphite pencils are good for producing midtones. Pencils can be used for doing light sketches, such as when doing line art. And ink can be used for making those lines more crisp.

Originally I had mostly focused on using mechanical pencils. Eventually I had moved onto using blue colored mechanical pencils, for which the original reason for those had been that blue line art would not show up in a copy machine. I also liked to use it as an error correction tool.

It is not always necessarily to use every levels of tone available, although I personally prefer at least three levels. Generally this would be the basic pencil sketches, then shading with charcoal, and then final inking with a dip pen to flesh out its appearance.

It should also be noted that sometimes using to many tones can often be to much detail depending on the panel that you are wanting to sketch. Just go with the levels of shade that is appropriate for the kind of panel that you are wanting to convey.

In some cases, having panels that only have two levels of shading is appropriate for the context, such as in caricatures. However in a realistic sketch, generally the levels of shade you need is based on the direction of the light source, with different areas having more color variation than others. Generally the closer to a light source, the less shade variation.

In conclusion, this is why I personally prefer knowledge in as many art mediums as possible, so I can fully explore their strengths and weaknesses. I want to have experience in both traditional art media and digital media, so that I can improvise when the need arises.
